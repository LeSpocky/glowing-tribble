# glowing-tribble

Webserver example using
[libhttpserver](https://github.com/etr/libhttpserver) and
[CMake](https://cmake.org/).

You can build this from your favorite embedded BSP or on your host with
both *libhttpserver* and
[libmicrohttpd](https://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd/) development
headers installed.
Or you might be interested how to build this as part of my
[glowing-tribble-build](https://github.com/LeSpocky/glowing-tribble-build)
CMake superbuild project, which builds *libhttpserver* and
*libmicrohttpd* along with the app.
